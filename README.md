### Characterizing the regulatory contexts of murine microglia heterogeneity

This repository contains the code needed to reproduce parts of my PhD manuscript Chapter 3 (gene regulatory networks).

The repository containing the code for Chapter 2 - [Lawrence et al., (2024) *Cell*](<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.01.012>) - is available [here](<https://github.com/claire-lansonneur/Lawrence-et-al-2024-Cell>).

* The code for my PhD will be available before 01/01/2025.
* All code here has been used to create figures and analysis in the thesis.
* Conda environments are in the "conda envs" folder.
